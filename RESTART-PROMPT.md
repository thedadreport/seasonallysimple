# Restart Prompt for Claude Code

Copy and paste this prompt when you want to continue development on the Seasonally Simple project:

```
Hi Claude! I'm continuing development on my Seasonally Simple app, an AI-powered recipe app that uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet to generate personalized recipes based on seasonal ingredients and user preferences.

We previously implemented authentication with NextAuth.js and set up the basic app structure. The app uses Next.js, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. We have a SQLite database with Prisma for development.

According to our roadmap, the next step is to connect to a PostgreSQL database for production. Please help me:

1. Set up a PostgreSQL connection in our Prisma schema
2. Update the necessary environment variables
3. Create migration scripts to convert from SQLite to PostgreSQL

Please check the DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, and other project files to understand the current state of the project before making any changes.
```

Feel free to modify this prompt to focus on whichever next step you'd like to work on from the development roadmap.
